/* I got all the coding I didnt know from one place.
 W3Schools. (2019). How to CSS Code. Retrieved December 3, 2019, from https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp.
 This is where I found coding for the color codes, the drop down hover navigation, the order here button and the form/submit button*/

document.getElementById("orderbutton").onclick=function () {location.href= "location.html";}

function myFunction() {alert("The form was submitted");}
