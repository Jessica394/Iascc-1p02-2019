              My name is Kristina Rose-marie Albright and welcome to my artistry page. <br />
              I went to Flemming college for Art in Haliburton, ON. my passion has always been painting and while I still love to paint, it is harder to sell then the craft I learned from school. <br />
              Pottery has advanced my creativity and increased my passion. <br />
              I currently work as a pottery technition at the Kawartha Pottery Guild in Peterbourogh. I recently visited South Korea to learn from their pottery masters and absorb some of the skills that have been passed down thorough the generations. <br />
              I was surprising applauded for my interest as apprentaly there are fewer and fewer young adults going into art as a career and it needs to be preserved. </p>
